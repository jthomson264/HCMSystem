Documented Deviations or Assumptions from the Original Specs
--------------
- Data access to Doctors would be granted by a patient searching for a doctor and granting them permission to view thier records
- We decided that only patients would be able to give access to a doctor request and NOT vice versa
	- This is because it does not make sense for a patient to send a doctor a request for the doctor to view the patient's data
	- This gives patients control of their own privacy as to who is veiwing their data
- Once a doctor is given access, that doctors single admin would also get access to edit the patient's records
- We also agreed that you can think of a doctor's independant practice as basically the same thing as a hospital.
	- Each has its own medical facility, which contains multiple admins (Hospital Reps) who then preform the adminitrative tasks for a set of doctors
	- Therefore, we also changed "Hospital Rep" to the more general term "Admin" as "Hospital Rep" implies that they only work at hospitals, which is not the case in our interpretation
- The Doctor/Patient relationship is many to many
- The Admin/Doctor relationship is one to many respectively
- The Hospital/Admin relationship is one to many respectively
- Adding the functionality to REMOVE doctor data access request by the patient to limit data sharing
	- In case the patient switches doctors or is completed treatment
